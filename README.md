n the project focusing on the Amazon front page, my role involved revamping the user interface and functionality to enhance the overall browsing experience. I began by conducting an in-depth analysis of Amazon's existing front page layout and user interaction flow. Based on insights gathered, I proposed and implemented a new design strategy aimed at improving usability, accessibility, and engagement. Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I crafted a responsive and visually appealing layout that seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes and devices. I integrated dynamic features like product carousels, personalized recommendations, and interactive elements to enrich user engagement and encourage exploration. Performance optimization was also a key focus, achieved through code minification, image compression, and asynchronous loading techniques. As a result of these efforts, the revamped Amazon front page witnessed a noticeable increase in user satisfaction metrics and conversion rates.
